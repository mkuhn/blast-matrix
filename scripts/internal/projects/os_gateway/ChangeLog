    Finalize version 1.3.1, with the following major changes relative to 1.3.0:
     * Allow cross-service sharing of DBAPI objects as appropriate.
     * Ensure that connection-pool cleanup occurs regularly rather than
       waiting indefinitely for idleness.
     * Support (trial) backends not known to the load balancer.
     * Log more information that may ease troubleshoooting.

    Finalize version 1.3.0, with the following major changes relative to 1.2.3:
     * Advance to 6.x stable components (dbase 6.1, otherwise 6.0),
       picking up various improvements in base libraries.
     * Support hard and soft limits on the number of client connections.
     * Generally improve timeout handling.
     * Improve backend selection; in particular, correct server
       preference logic and ensure pool diversity to limit the
       potential impact of bad backends.
     * Adapt to in-house CentOS systems, which lack the pidof utility
       (but still at least have pgrep).
     * Allow more threads (100, not just 10).

       of notifications under some circumstances.

2009-05-22 10:51:07:
    Finalize version 1.2.2, with the following major changes relative to 1.2.1:
     * Pick up latest fixes to 4.0.0 stable components.
     * Fix a logic error that could lead to null pointer exceptions.
     * Try resetting the DB connection factory when it yields no backends,
       to compensate for overly persistent blacklisting.

2009-05-06 14:52:59:
    Slip belated infrastructure changes into version 1.2.1 (binaries untouched):
     * Track probe results and report appropriate penalties to LBSMD.

    Finalize version 1.2.1, with the following major changes relative to 1.2.0:
     * Pick up latest fixes to 4.0.0 stable components.
     * Fix a logic error that could result in truncated responses when

     * Ensure that exceptions that somehow slip through the cracks
       receive proper backtraces to help debug their causes.

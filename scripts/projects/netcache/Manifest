# Purpose: This file holds all the supported configurations of a package
#          It is used by release configurator.
#

APP: netcached test_ic_client test_netcache_api test_nc_stress
ETC: src/app/netcache/netcached.ini

# Each line describes a single configuration
# The format is as follows:
# <HardwareIdentifier> : <ReleaseSuffix> : <CompilerConfigurationScriptWithKeys>
# Configuration script is relative to c++/compilers/unix/ .
# Release configurator assumes that this script will eventually call standard configure script and pass all options
# to it. So some standard options may be added by release configurator, such as --build-root-sfx, --with-projects,
# --with-distcc, --with-action etc.
